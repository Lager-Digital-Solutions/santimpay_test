## Santimpay gateway SDK

### Main functionalities:
The SantimpaySdk class is designed to provide a simple interface for generating signed tokens and initiating payments through the SantimPay API. It allows developers to easily create payment URLs for their customers, with the option to use a test bed environment for development and testing.

### Methods:
- `constructor(merchantId, privateKey, testBed)`: initializes the class with the provided merchant ID and private key, and sets the base URL to either the production or test environment depending on the value of the testBed parameter.
- `generateSignedToken(amount, paymentReason)`: generates a signed token using the provided amount, payment reason, and merchant ID, along with the current timestamp.
- `generatePaymentUrl(id, amount, paymentReason, successRedirectUrl, failureRedirectUrl, notifyUrl)`: sends a request to the SantimPay API to initiate a payment with the provided parameters, including the signed token generated by the generateSignedToken method.

### Fields:
- `privateKey`: the private key used to sign tokens and initiate payments.
- `merchantId`: the ID of the merchant associated with the payments.
- `baseUrl`: the base URL for the SantimPay API, set to either the production or test environment depending on the value of the testBed parameter.
